Description: The package estimates wildlife population density based on the simulation of individual movement within the camera grid. Simulated individuals follow a correlated random walk with the movement parameters of step length, angular deflection, daily movement distance and home range size derived from empirical movement paths. Movement is simulated under a series of population densities. We matched the simulated results with observed photo records using a machine learning algorithm, random forest, to calculate expected population densities and 95% confidence intervals. Data of 14 animal species (in total 102 movement paths) are included in this package. This package is suitable for estimating densities of animals that cannot be individually identified, and the cameras are deployed in a grid pattern.
